This file details the choices I made for this project and why I made them, as requested. 

## README

I couldn't think of a random project to create a fake README for, so I used one of my previous projects as a template. Much of the "instructions" are copied from the project, but they have been reorganized and the descriptions have been improved in order to describe and document the project a little better than before. If you wish to specifically see the differences, you can find the project [here](https://jfenn.me/projects/mdjavadoc).

There are two reasons that I have not made these changes from the start with the original project:

1. There are not enough contributors or even users for me to consider a code of conduct; unless it develops significant interest, a simple dictatorship with me as the sole ruler should be sufficient to resolve most issues.
2. Since the two API/CLI modules are published separately on NPM, they must have their own individual READMEs in addition to one for the "main" project. As I did not want to state everything three times (and thus have three changes to make whenever a function is changed), I split up the documentation between these files.

## License

As this script is fairly small and has only one simple purpose, I put it under the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/). This basically allows people to do whatever they want with it as long as they don't hold me responsible for my terrible code when it inevitably fails, which fits my needs perfectly.

## Code of Conduct

I have been following the meritocracy-related debates fairly closely, and I originally believed that meritocracy was the correct way to go about moderating a large project such as the Linux Kernel, but that there were some significant changes to be made in order to make it more beginner-friendly; mainly that a high merit should not allow one to insult less known contributors and devalue their work, and that clear and non-threatening explanations should be given for why a certain contribution was rejected or accepted over another.

However, during the lab, I realized that the purpose of the contributor covenant is essentially what I just described. In addition, having a code of conduct that is used by as many different projects as it is will likely increase the amount of contributors as they do not have to worry about complying with it (or encountering someone that isn't) if they already know what it enforces.
